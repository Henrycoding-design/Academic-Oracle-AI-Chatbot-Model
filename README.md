# Academic Oracle

**Academic Oracle** is a learning-focused AI platform designed to maximize understanding, not passive consumption.

Instead of immediately giving answers, Academic Oracle follows a scientifically grounded flow:

> **Ask → Think → Hint → Attempt → Feedback → Pattern → Insight → Mastery**

The goal is not memorization — it’s *deep, durable learning*.

---

## Why Academic Oracle?

Most AI tools optimize for speed.  
Academic Oracle optimizes for **retention, intuition, and reasoning**.

### Core Learning Principles
- Active recall before answers
- Progressive hinting instead of instant solutions
- Error-correction loops
- Pattern discovery over rote explanation
- Minimal UI disruption to maintain cognitive flow

You don’t just learn faster — you learn *properly*.

---

## Features

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

2. Setup Environment Variables:
   ```env.local

## Project Vision

Academic Oracle aims to *redefine how AI integrates into education*:
- Not as a solver.
- Not as a shortcut.
**But as a structured reasoning partner.**

The long-term goal is to build *a universal academic cognition system* that scales from secondary education to research-level inquiry.
